        <p> Our business was established in 2020, right after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
          Initially, we operated from a small space within a road testing station, where we where
          fortunate to be surrounded by amazing people who provided us with invaluable support
          during those early days.
        </p>
        <p> Despite facing numerous challenges and hard times, we persevered, and with gratitude to
          the Lord, we were able to expand our operations to a larger yard. This expansion has allowed
          us to offer a wider range of products to our customers.
        </p>
        <p> We pride ourselves on selling only the highest quality poles and timber. All our products
          are SABS approved and H4 CCA treated, ensuring durability and reliablity. Our inventory includes
          gum poles, timber, ridging, tanks, and even compost, catering to various needs in the market.
        </p>
        <p> Each year we strive to improve our offerings and grow our business. However, the current economic
          climate presents its own set of challenges, making it tough to navigate. Neverthless, we remain
          steadfast in our faith, trusting that our doors will always be open for our customers.
        </p>
        <p> We would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt gratitude to our loyal
          customers for their unwavering support. Your trust in us has been instrumental in our
          journey, and we look forward to continuing to serve you with the best products and services.
        </p>
